# To Infinity but not Quite

Buzz Lightyear is trying to travel to infinity and beyond, but he can't quite make it. He does have a few fuel capsules though, and the `i`th fuel capsule allows Buzz Lightyear to travel a distance of `d\sub{i}`. Buzz wants to know if he has enough fuel to travel a total distance of `T`, and if he does, the minimum number of capsules he needs to use. Help Buzz figure this out!

Note that Buzz can use the fuel capsules in whatever order he wants.

## Input Format

The first line of the input will contain two integers:

* `F`: the number of fuel cells
* `T`: the distance that Buzz wants to travel

The next `F` lines will each have a single integer `d\sub{i}`, the distance that the `i`th fuel cell can travel.

## Constraints

* `1 <= F <= 100`
* `1 <= d\sub{i} <= 1000`
* `1 <= T <= 10^5`

## Output Format

A single integer denoting the minimum number of fuel cells required, or `-1` if it is not possible for Buzz to travel a distance of `T`.
